# Some Batch Scripts
A collection of Windows .BAT &amp; .CMD scripts that may aid in your quest to automate things, or just to do something neat!


### Command execution timer
*timeit.cmd*
Call it with commands as your perameters and it will execute them and display the time it took to complete the command.

### Little batch script organizer
*script-manager.bat*
Finds batch files named "main.bat" contained in child directories of its own, uses the .bat file's directory to name it, and can enumerate information written in a brief.txt placed next to each application. Uses all of this to list all of the applications it finds in a "main menu", allowing you to quickly start any of your many batch scripts.

### File name scrambler
*file-name-scrambler.bat*
Does exactly what you'd think it does in whatever directory it's placed in! It was also my first published coding project on GitHub it seems, so horray for <a href="https://github.com/alexlyee/file-name-scrambler">nostalgia</a>!
